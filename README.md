# Campus Management Tool: Server

This project involves developing a Campus Management System using the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) stack. Users can perform CRUD operations on campuses and students, including viewing, adding, editing, and deleting entries. The website serves as a platform for managing information related to campuses and students efficiently. It aims to provide users with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface where they can easily perform various tasks related to campus administration. This is the backend of the application.
